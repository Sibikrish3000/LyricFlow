[00:50.83]I have a little house
[01:05.46]Close to town, but not to the city
[01:12.85]Far from home, but near my family
[01:18.25]No water views, but so close to the sea
[01:23.70]I see
[01:25.66]This is how my little life could be...
[01:31.00]And I'm filling it with things
[01:37.49]Like furniture that I find on the street
[01:42.06]And all the special things I'd like to eat
[01:47.58]Pictures of people that I'd like to meet
[01:53.97]I'll meet them when I'm orbiting the world...
[01:59.42]...And it's so pretty...
[02:03.02]...And so lonely...
[02:04.87]My little love affairs
[02:11.26]Are all scheduled 'round the TV guide
[02:16.74]And my sex life has all been plagiarized
[02:23.16]In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline...
[02:28.62]I'd like to rent-a-wife
[02:40.46]Then rent a husband to keep her for life
[02:43.29]The three of us, we could be so happy
[02:45.06]Them with each other, me with company
[02:49.65]I'll see them off on a flight around the world...
[02:55.13]...And it's so pretty...
[02:58.74]...And so lonely...
[03:03.30]I could just die
[03:09.78]I might just die
[03:15.24]I could just die
[03:20.69]I might just die
[03:28.03]...And at my funeral
[03:29.88]They will say "Tom, he was such a nice guy,
[03:41.71]He went too early, but he went in style."
[03:42.66]They'll play my music and then they will cry
[03:47.15]They'll have a little wake
[03:55.46]They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
[03:57.22]And my mother's little heart will break
[04:03.65]And she will say:
[04:10.03]"Wait! There must be some mistake,
[04:10.92]He can't be dead
[04:11.84]Take me instead!"
[04:13.70]Oh, but I'm not dead
[04:20.10]They tell me I'm not dead
[04:25.52]They say that I'm not dead
[04:31.02]And I won't die for some time...
[04:36.53]I'm in my little house
[04:47.59]Just writing little songs to pass the time
[04:48.49]Which incidentally is seven forty-nine
[04:51.27]So don't you worry, I'm completely fine
[04:55.75]I'm fine
[04:57.60]Don't you worry, I'm completely fine
[05:01.23]I'm fine
[05:03.04]Don't you worry, I'm completely fine
[05:05.86]I'm fine
[05:08.59]Don't you worry, I'm completely fine
[05:12.28]I'm fine, I am just so f*cking fine
[05:24.00]
