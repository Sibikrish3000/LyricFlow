[00:04.84]If you could fly away from the world that was left behind a second ago,
[00:52.66]The proof that I was here,
[00:55.08]The bones will melt away anyway,
[01:02.30]And disappear,
[01:05.54]I'm here
[01:24.96]The voice of a friend who was swallowed, born,
[01:33.98]The reason why it can't be the end,
[01:39.12]I'll build a desert
[01:48.40]The road that begins here,
[01:49.96]The sky that looks like that,
[01:52.16]Because this is the first time you come out
[02:03.02]Countless birds that fly away,
[02:05.18]Scatter their wings and laugh at the end
[02:11.90]The proof that I was here,
[02:23.10]The bones will melt away anyway,
[02:30.20]And disappear,
[02:32.56]I'm here
[02:38.64]The bones will melt away anyway,
[02:41.84]And disappear,
[02:41.88]I'm here
